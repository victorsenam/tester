The best versions are `5-3-24`, `5-2-8` and `4-2-35`. They have the most realiable `judge.sh` samples.

# Best ones
## 4-2-35
Print the core vertices of a DAG. Simple judge.sh, good example of tester use. Doesn't use a Runner, also.

## 5-2-8
Ordered statistics on a Trie. Comes with a fix for submissions with 1-indexed answers. Partial correction sample.

## 5-3-24
KMP, BoyerMoore and Brute Matching tester. The tested program should return an iterator over the occurences of the pattern on the strings. The tests there are quite weak on Time Limits, sadly. Multiple Runners and partial scoring sample.

# Ok
## 4-2-26
2-SAT checker, generator and validator. Simple judge.sh example. Good checker example.

## 4-2-33
Checker, generator and validator for counting the number of paths in a DAG generated by a set of strings.

## list
Checker for data structure with lots of different queries on log(n) time. Accepts limited solutions in a way. It needs a lot of manual help, but the tester was quite good, I didin't specify the problem very well which forced me to get quite manual.

## pc2d
Minimal spanning Tree on a geometric graph (points on an unitary square, every pair of points with less than d distance is connected).

# Ignorable
## 1-3-35
Uses a whole different version of the tester. The whole work is left to the runner, works like a unit test tool.

## 1-3-36
Mostly manual.

## 3-1-52
Also doesn't use the tester.

## 3-2-37
Primordial tester.
